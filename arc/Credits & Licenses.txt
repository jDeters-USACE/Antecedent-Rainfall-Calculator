I did not expect to publish this package externally, but now that I am, I should
document who made it possible and what their licensing terms are.

Enormous thanks to the creators of the "Ulmo" package for getting me started
pulling data from NCDC.  I barely knew how to script ArcMap when I started 
this project, and I doubt I would have made much progress without the initial
leg up from this module. Contributers include: Erek Alper,
Francesc Alted, Bryan Anderson, Cameron Bracken, Tim Cera, Cédric David,
Anthony Ford, Jiří Kadlec, Victor Klepikovskiy, Nikolay Koldunov,
Emilio Mayorga, Tyler McEwen, Solomon Negusse, Dharhas Pothina, rockg,
Colin Talbert, and Andy Wilson.
